# Example file to do the following:
# Create a model with 4 columns, 4 column-heads and 1 plate.
# Compute interactions between the elements. TODO: Add interactions and the base element level when geometry is computed.
# Change one column head and check if the elements are dirty.
# Recompute the modelgeometry.
